# 👋 Hey there, I'm Kritin Kaul

I'm a **Computer Science student** with a strong interest in **Software Engineering**, **Data Analysis**, and **Product Thinking**. I enjoy solving real-world problems through code and building thoughtful, user-centric solutions.

Outside of tech, I’m a creative at heart — into movies, storytelling, and digital creation. I often find that these passions inspire my approach to software: design with empathy, build with purpose.

🎯 I'm actively looking for **internship opportunities** where I can contribute meaningfully and continue growing alongside a talented team.
