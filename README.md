##👋 Hey, I’m Kritin**

I’m a Computer Science student who enjoys building software that actually does something useful.
My interests sit at the intersection of Software Engineering, Data Analysis, and Product Thinking — turning ideas into clean, user-centric solutions.

I like solving real-world problems with code, thinking through why something should exist before jumping into how to build it.

##🧠 How I Think About Software**

Outside of tech, I’m a creative at heart — into movies, storytelling, and digital creation.
That perspective sneaks into my engineering work more than I realized:

design with empathy • build with purpose • ship things people enjoy using

##🎯 What I’m Looking For

I’m actively exploring internship opportunities where I can:

contribute meaningfully (not just “shadow”)

learn from strong engineers

work on products that people genuinely rely on
